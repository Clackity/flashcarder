card 1 side a
card 1 side b

card 2 side a
card 2 side b

card 3 side a
card 3 side b

you can see
how this goes

a pair of lines makes
the two sides of a card

an empty line between cards
separates them from each other

when an open file is written
cards gain lines of numbers

the first number
is the "ease bias"

the second is
the unix "last seen" time

the third is
the view count
